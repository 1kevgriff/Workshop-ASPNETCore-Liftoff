# Prepare Your ASP.NET Core Application for ðŸš€ Liftoff: Hardening Your Applications for Production

## Abstract
How launch-ready is your ASP.NET Core architecture?  Can you handle an indeterminate scale over time?  Does your application report what's it doing overtime?  Can anyone on your team actually read the logs and create actionable feedback from them?  

Is deployment an "all hands on deck" scenario?  Does deployment happen continuously, quarterly, or somewhere in between?  Is being on-call stressful and anxiety-provoking?

If you shook your head reading any of these questions, it is a good chance your applications are not launch-ready!

In this full-day workshop, you'll be taken on a journey to build launch-ready, battle-hardened ASP.NET Core Architectures.  You'll learn about tracking application health with Health Checks, logging application telemetry and diagnostic information, and tracking configuration and secrets across multiple environments.  Additionally, you'll receive hands-on experience with deployment automation, and building maintenance strategies only SpaceX would dream about!
