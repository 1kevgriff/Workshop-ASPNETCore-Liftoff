# Lab: Health Checks

> Recommended lab time: 30 minutes

As has been discussed in the workshop, Health Checks are a major feature of ASP.NET Core that allows you to quickly get an "at-a-glance" view of how your current applications is running.

## Setup

In the Whisky.API repository, open the "06_HealthChecks" solution.  

This project contains a basic implementation of Health Checks for our Azure Queues.

## Your Job

Take a few minutes and work on implementing a health check or two that does the following:

* Checks to see if the whisky.csv file exists
* Checks tos ee if the notifications.json file exists
